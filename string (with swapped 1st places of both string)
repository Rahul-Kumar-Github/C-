/*Problem

C++ provides a nice alternative data type to manipulate strings, and the data type is conveniently called string. Some of its widely used features are the following:

Declaration:
string a = "abc";

Size:
int len = a.size();

Concatenate two strings:
string a = "abc";
string b = "def";
string c = a + b; // c = "abcdef".

Accessing i th element:
string s = "abc";
char   c0 = s[0];   // c0 = 'a'
char   c1 = s[1];   // c1 = 'b'
char   c2 = s[2];   // c2 = 'c'

s[0] = 'z';         // s = "zbc"

P.S.: We will use cin/cout to read/write a string.

Input Format
You are given two strings, a and b, separated by a new line. Each string will consist of lower case Latin characters ('a'-'z').

Output Format
In the first line print two space-separated integers, representing the length of a and b, respectively.
In the second line print the string produced by concatenating a and b(a+b).
In the third line print two strings separated by a space, a' and b'.a' and b' are the same as a and b, respectively, except that their first characters are swapped.


Sample Input :
abcd
ef

Sample Output :
4 2
abcdef
ebcd af

Explanation :
a  = "abcd"
b  = "ef"
|a| = 4
|b| = 2
a+b = "abcdef"
a' = "ebcd"
b' = "af"
